## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program ‚Äì November 2017 update, released by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

- Focused on female patients diagnosed with invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (code 8522/3) between 2006 and 2010.
- Final dataset included 4024 patients after preprocessing.

### Preprocessing Steps

- Removed patients with unknown tumor size or unexamined regional lymph nodes.
- Excluded patients with survival time less than one month.
- Converted categorical features to numerical values.
- Normalized the data using Z-score normalization.
- Split the data into:
  - 90% training
  - 10% testing

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms for predicting breast cancer patient survival. Accurate predictions can support:

- Informed treatment planning
- Efficient allocation of medical resources
- Better support for patients and their families in decision-making
